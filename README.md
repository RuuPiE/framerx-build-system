- [ ] Group
- [ ] InputText
- [ ] Label
- [x] Toggle

- [ ] Monitor Pill
- [ ] Time Pill
- [ ] Avatar
- [x] NumberedSection
- [ ] NumberedTitle
- [ ] Tag
- [ ] FacetValue
- [x] [CONSTANTS](https://github.com/DataDog/druids/blob/master/index.ts#L71)


>  The `druids` library supports every components mentioned above. It's only the `druids.framerx` file that supports the one's checked.

_ðŸ‘† This info is specific to people who can to use druids in any ES6 project._


## Instructions

### Using with React/ES6

- Pull this repo and run `yarn link` (this links the `druid` npm package linkable)
- Now head to your React project or [create one](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/#creating-an-app)
- In your project, run `yarn link druids` to link the local package
- Now open your `App.js` and import any component `import { Button } from 'druids'`
- Refer the [React styleguide](https://dd.datad0g.com/internal/styleguide/react) for component documentation.

### Using with Framer X

Unfortunately, the current file structure of Framer X does not allow for easy versioning in Github. In order to temporarily mitigate this there will have to be some manual work involved.

- Download the [druids.framerx file](https://github.com/DataDog/druids/blob/master/druids.framerx?raw=true)
- Rename the file to `MyProject.framerx`
- Open the file in Framer X
- Select Components on the Framer X left-side panel
- Find your desired component and drag into the canvas
- Available properties (e.g. title, type, color...) display on the right-side panel of the interface when a component is selected
